Warpoints Installation @ Jackdevo dev@itsjack.dev
Note: When copying code, copy everything after the denoted arrow '-->'

Complete the folowing steps in order:

--------------
Mission Setup
--------------

1. Copy the file 'Script/Config_Warpoints.hpp' in to the '/config' folder in your mission

2. Copy the file 'Script/fn_warpoints.sqf' in to the '/core/medical' folder in your mission

3. Go in to the file '/config/Config_Master' and add this line of code
--> #include "Config_Warpoints.hpp"

4. Go in to '/Functions.hpp' and underneath 'class revivePlayer {};' add this line of code
--> class warpoints {};

5. Go in to '/core/medical/fn_onPlayerKilled.sqf', add this line of code at the end of the file
--> [2, _unit, _killer] call life_fnc_warpoints;

6. Go in to '/CfgRemoteExec.hpp', add this line of code under '/* Functions for Everyone */'
--> F(hint,ANYONE)

--------------
DB Setup
--------------

1. In your database execute the following SQL statement
-->  ALTER TABLE players ADD warpoints INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT '0'

--------------
Configuration
--------------

The configuration file should be laid out pretty clearly, but here is an overview:

There are three distance multipliers:
	normalRange = After killing someone at 0-300m, warpoints GAINED multiplied by specified amount
	mediumRange = After killing someone at 300-500m, warpoints GAINED multiplied by specified amount
	longRange = After killing someone at 500+, warpoints GAINED multiplied by specified amount
	
Distance multipliers do not affect warpoints lost by victims

The value of 'playerIDfield' should corrospond to the name of the database field that deals with PlayerID's, it should
either be "playerID" or "pid" in usual circumstances. For 5.0 servers, leave this value as the default.


Under 'Config_Weapons {' there are two example classes. Do not delete the default class!!

Each class name corrosponds to a gun classname, in the event of being killed/killing using said gun, the amount of
warpoints specified for victim/killer will be gained/lost. If a player is killed by a weapon that isn't speciifed in the config,
the values in the default class will be used.

--------------
USAGE
--------------

This script has two main functions:

- Get current warpoints
- Add/Remove warpoints

To get a players current warpoints as an integer, you call the function:
	_wp = [0, player] call life_fnc_warpoints;
To update a players warpoints, call this function:
	[1, player, amount] call life_fnc_warpoints;
	
Notes:
	In the above two examples, 'player' can be one of the following:
		- Player ID of player to alter warpoints for (as an integer or a string)
		- Player Object (e.g _unit)
		- An empty string (Meaning the player that the code is being ran on)
		
	Pretty simple stuff, but to remove warpoints use a negative integer as the amount parameter. Don't be a spoon.
	
WARNING:
	When players are killed, the script will NOT allow the warpoint value of a player to go below zero.
	
	When altering warpoints manually through the function, it would be good practice to not allow warpoints of a player,
	to go below zero, by first checking their warpoint balance. Otherwise, you would be a spoon.
	
	
First installation guide I have ever made so please give me some tips, so I can re-write it!
